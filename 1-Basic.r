# R is a Free & Open Source Programming Language mainly used for Statistical Computing. 
# R is popularly using for Data Science and Data Analytic. Since it provides so many supported packages to hangle big amount of statistical data.
# At my point of view, the structure of R language is similar like Javascript + Python.

# Defining Variables in R
first <- 3
second <- "I am String"
third <- FALSE
# here we have defined variable called first, second, thord with value 3, "I am String" and FALSE respectively. These variables are also called objects which be learn in coming chapters.
# To print value of first variable, print() method is used.
print(first)

# We don't need to define the datatype when defining a variable
# Like python, it is not mandatory to terminate a line with semicolon(;)

# Basic Airthmatic Operation

# Like any other language, R also supports basic airthmatic operation on varilable and scalers.

one <- 1
two <- 2

three <- one + two
print(three) # would result => 3

# Similarly other operation(-, *, /, ^(exponent), %%(modulas)) etc can also be performed.
